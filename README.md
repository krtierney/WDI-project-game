# Fox: A Game

Students in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) program are given four days to build a simple game using the front-end development technologies that are taught over the first two weeks of the course. Prior to enrolling in WDI, I spent my first year in London working as a bartender, walking home from work through the city in the early hours of the morning. _Fox_ was inspired by my observations of London's noctural urban wildlife during this time. You can play a deployed version of the game on [Heroku](https://fox-the-game.herokuapp.com).

## Gameplay
_Fox_ is a simple side-scrolling adventure game. Players follow the fox on her journey and can influence her actions as she encounters a variety of obstacles. Movement is controlled by arrow keys, and choices based on text prompts are also assigned to key inputs. Decisions can result in points being added or subtracted, and players are moved along or routed to alternate branches within the level based on their choices. Players can reach the win condition at the end of the level only if they've accrued enough points from their actions – if not, they lose.

## Build
While the website for _Fox_ was built with **HTML** and styled with **CSS**, the actual game itself is contained within the **HTML5 Canvas** element and written in **Javascript**. In the WDI course, we spent one day on curricula related to HTML and CSS, and the remainder of the first two weeks learning the basic ins and outs of front-end Javascript. By this point in the course, I'd built up confidence and proficiency with DOM manipulation and basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I was interested in independently building a working knowledge of the canvas element to complement the course curriculum, and designing and building the game level provided an excellent framework for gaining that knowledge – as well as demonstrating my aptitude for **self-directed learning** across a range of technologies.

Project planning incorporated other key steps of the front-end development process as well: the entire first day of the project was devoted to **content strategy**, **copywriting**, and **script development**, building **wireframes** in **Adobe InDesign**, and laying out a detailed **development timeline**. The final project day was reserved for **testing**, **refactoring**, and **bug fixes**.
