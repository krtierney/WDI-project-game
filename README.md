#Fox: A Story and A Game

*Fox* is a simple adventure game built using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. The first level was built in one weekend in July 2016 to fulfill the Project #1 Assignment for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.  Since our task was to build a game using front-end technologies covered in weeks one and two of the course, I challenged myself to learn to use the canvas element in order to practice my Javascript skills and to build up my personal comfort level with learning new technologies independently.


More features, improved visual design, and additional levels will be added as time permits. Next steps: Add mouse and touch controls.
