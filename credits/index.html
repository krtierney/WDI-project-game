  <div class="text-box credits"><p>This game was made in one weekend in July 2016 as a course assignment. That would not have been possible without the generous artists who contribute their work to <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>. Credit is due for the following image assets used in this work:</p>
  <p>
    Fox by M Turan Ercan; fox face by Julian Roman; cityscape (background) by Charlotte Vogel; dog by Daniel Schroeder; flying owl by Eric Bergholz; owl by Sagit Milshtein; cat by icons.design; puddle by Nicky Knicky; dirt by Shawn Erdely; doodle (used as broken glass) by Kyle Tezak; rat (standing upright) by Timothy Dilich; rat by Francisca Ar√©valo. And, if you happened to win the game: food bowl by Jennifer Cozzette; girl silhouette by Melvin Poppelaars; house by Megan Mitchell and fireworks by James Keuning.

  <p>The soundtrack is a track called "Bury That Melody (Wasn't Me Reprise) by the inimitable <a href="http://cinchel.bandcamp.com">cinchel</a>.</p>
